# Usage

Currently, the simulator is available for use from a Commnad Line Interface or from a web application. It can run in whatever OS.

It is needed java version 8 or later in your computer.

## Simulation Parameters

### Number of Rounds
A interger number to determinate the number of times the simulation will run with the specified scenario, in order to get all results and make the average.

### Message Generation

It determines the message generation that will be used. There are 3 parameters:

- #### type: There are 3 avaiable types:
  - FIXED_NODES: One node specified by the user will have a message whose destination is other node specified by the user. That is, there is just one message in all simulation.
  
  - RANDOM_NODES: One random node will have a message whose destination is other random node. That is, there is just one message in all simulation.
  
  - ALL_PAIRS: Each node will have n-1 messages, each one to a other node destination. That is, there are n*(n-1) messages in the simulation, since node i will have a messagem to node j and j will have a message to node i.

- #### Generation Instant:
A double number to determinate in which instant the all messages of simulation will be generated in the respectives source nodes.

- #### Amount Of Nodes:
A integer number to determinate the total number of nodes in the simulation.


### Protocol

It determines the fowarding protocol tha will be used in the simulation. It may be have 4 parameters:

- #### type: There are 6 avaiable protocol types:
  - EPIDEMIC
  - SINGLE_COPY_EPIDEMIC
  - EPIDEMIC_P_Q
  - SPRAY_AND_WAIT
  - BINARY_SPRAY_AND_WAIT
  - DIRECT_DELIVERY

- L: It means the L-parameter (number of messages copies) of SPRAY_AND_WAIT and BINARY_SPRAY_AND_WAIT protocols. So, it must be informed only for use of SPRAY_AND_WAIT and BINARY_SPRAY_AND_WAIT protocols.

- p: It means the p-parameters (probability to occour a message trasnfer between two relay nodes) of EPIDEMIC_P_Q protocol. So, it must be informed only for use of EPIDEMIC_P_Q protocol.

- q: It means the p-parameters (probability to occour a message trasnfer between the source and any relay node) of EPIDEMIC_P_Q protocol. So, it must be informed only for use of EPIDEMIC_P_Q protocol.

### Meeting Trace

It determines how the meet between pairs will be generated. There are 3 parameters:

- #### type: 
Only EXPONENTIAL type is avaiable. That is, the interval between meet for each pair will be modelated by a exponential probability distribution and each interval until next meet will be calculated using the Inverse Transform Sampling method using the meet rate of each pair how the Î»-parameter.

- #### pairDefinitionFile:
Name of json file that contains the meet rate of each pair. This file must be located at pairDefinitionFile folder, inside input folder.

- #### totalSimulationTime: 
A double number to determine the total simulation time

## Simulation Report
The main simulation result consists by a .txt file containing the average of delivery ratio and delay of the messages of all rounds. Besisdes, the simulation generate other metrics to user analysis. For each round:

### Summary
Average of delivery ratio and delay of the messages.

### MeetingTrace
The meeting trace generated and used in the respective round.

### MessageDelivery
It shows, for each message, its events for generation, trasmission and delivery.

### MessageReport
Temporal description of events involving simulation messages.

## Usage

Download the IONS-Simulator.zip [here](https://github.com/PFC-IME-Opportunistic-Network-Simulator/backend/releases/download/1.0/IONS-Simulator.zip) and unzip the file.

There are two folders, CLI and WebInterface.


### Command Line Application

Open a terminal in CLI (Command Line Interface) folder and run:

```
java -jar CLI_IONS_Simulator.jar -i <config file>
```
The config file must to be located at input folder and it must be passed just the file name wiht its extension (without any path). This is a [toml file](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) that has all information needed to configure the simulation scenario.

In the dowloaded zip file, there are some configFiles (inside input folder) and some pairDefinitionFiles (inside pairDefinitionFile folder) for example files to test.

Open a terminal in executableJar folder, inside IONS-Simulator folder and run:

```
java -jar CLI_IONS_Simulator.jar -i configExample.toml
```

So, it will be generated a outupt folder with simulation report files.


### Web Application

First, to start the server, open a terminal in WebInterface folder and run:

```
java -jar Web_IONS_Simulator.jar
```
So, to use the simulator, go to folder UserInterface and open index.html in any browser.
